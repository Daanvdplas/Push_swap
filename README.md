# Push_swap

The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project:
data must be sorted.

You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions
to manipulate both stacks.

Your goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
that sorts the integers received as arguments.

## To run

Run the executable with a set of unique numbers, it will return the actions that have been executed to sort the stack.

### Progress

It was my first encounter with algorithms and code, which was very cool.
